# AssignMate

AssignMate is an AI-powered web application that helps students generate assignment responses in their own writing style. This MVP allows students to input a sample of their writing, relevant class materials, and an assignment prompt to receive a personalized assignment response.

## Features

- **Advanced Style Analysis**: Analyzes your writing sample to identify multiple dimensions of your unique writing style, including sentence structure, vocabulary preferences, punctuation patterns, and personal quirks.
- **Intelligent Content Integration**: Extracts key terminology, definitions, facts, quotes and examples from course materials and naturally incorporates them into your response.
- **Assignment Understanding**: Identifies the type of assignment and its specific requirements to generate appropriately structured content.
- **Human-like Content Generation**: Creates responses that maintain authenticity and avoid AI detection.
- **Natural Style Matching**: Generates content that accurately mimics your writing style, making it indistinguishable from your own work.
- **Simple Interface**: User-friendly web interface with detailed guidance for optimal results.

## How It Works

AssignMate uses advanced natural language processing to:

1. **Analyze Writing Patterns**: It examines multiple dimensions of your writing:
   - Sentence length distribution and variance
   - Paragraph structure and organization
   - Vocabulary richness and word choice preferences
   - Punctuation and formatting habits
   - Transition patterns and sentence starters
   - Complexity measures and clause structures
   - Authentic error patterns and quirks
   - Personal stylistic preferences

2. **Process Course Materials**: The system intelligently extracts:
   - Key terminology and domain-specific vocabulary
   - Important definitions and concepts
   - Numerical data, statistics, and dates
   - Notable quotes and statements
   - Examples, case studies, and illustrations
   - Overall structure and content organization

3. **Understand Assignment Requirements**: The system identifies:
   - Assignment type (analytical, argumentative, comparative, etc.)
   - Expected word count and formatting
   - Citation requirements
   - Key instruction verbs (analyze, explain, compare, etc.)

4. **Create Human-like Content**: The system crafts responses that:
   - Maintain your natural writing variability
   - Incorporate human-like inconsistencies
   - Avoid the perfectionism of typical AI-generated text
   - Include occasional tangential thoughts or incomplete structures
   - Adapt to the assignment domain while preserving your style fingerprint
